### CDS 492-Data Science Capstone

## Project Description and Summary 

In 2021 alone, the USFS (United States Fire Service) spent approximately $3,741,000,000 in fire suppression costs alone for wildfires across the United States (Center, N/a). The enormous burdens associated with wildfire occurrences represent a challenge in computational modelling research since there are numerous factors that arenâ€™t immediately measurable such as on-the-ground conditions (Cominique, 2019). 

This capstone project focuses on comparing clustering methods like K-means and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to determine any potential differing accuracies associated with their applications. There are pros and cons to utilizing varying approaches for UL clustering approaches such as employing a density-based algorithm over hierarchical-based. 

As an original research question, this projct aims to provide additional insight on utilizing clustering as a means of identifying key causes of wildfires. The problem we are aiming to solve is, how can clustering be utilized to determine the cause of wildfires when solely considering environmental factors? To answer and provide analysis to this question, different approaches to clustering will be compared and evaluated based on their co-similarities.
